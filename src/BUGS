BUGS

- Plugin does not distinct between files and folders
- `commandRescheduleEntry`: you can reschedule empty file
- `deleteFolderIfEmpty`: folder.name is checked against enum value, not actual congfig folder names
- `activeFile.path?.contains(POSTPONE_FOLDER_NAME)` is a bit too broad
- `moveFileAndCreateFolder` will catch ANY error
- completely unneeded para/project.ts
- `getRoot().name` is used for some reason, it's supposed to be empty
